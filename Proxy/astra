For console programs
Ex: wget, git and almost every console application which connects to internet.

If you want to configure proxy every time you run your commands for some reason then set the environment variables using following commands.

export http_proxy=http://DOMAIN\USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/
export ftp_proxy=http://DOMAIN\USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/

Else if you want to use the same settings everytime for all users, then use of these.

Configure in bashrc
$ nano /etc/bash.bashrc
export http_proxy=http://DOMAIN\USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/
export ftp_proxy=http://DOMAIN\USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/

Configure in /etc/environment

$ nano /etc/environment
https_proxy="http://myproxy.server.com:8080/" 
ftp_proxy="http://myproxy.server.com:8080/" ...

Configure using GUI
Open the network settings and set the your system wide network proxy.
Network -> Network proxy -> Configure -> Apply system wide.
But this might not be useful if you have authentication for the proxy.

For apt.
You need to do some extra work for apt, as incidentally apt doesn't obey environment variables,

$ nano /etc/apt/apt.conf
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT";
Acquire::https::Proxy "https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT";

For everything out of this scope, there must be an option to configure proxy settings in the application itself. If not I'm sorry ;)

From <https://askubuntu.com/questions/257290/configure-proxy-for-apt> 



f you need to use apt behind a proxy, probably everything else also needs the proxy config. I like to manage my proxy settings in one place, which would be the environment variable.
For that I create a /etc/profiles.d/99-proxy.sh, that contains the necessary proxy settings (like larent described):

export http_proxy=http://DOMAIN\USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/
export https_proxy=$http_proxy
export ftps_proxy=$http_proxy

that way, all users on that machine have access to the proxy. (don't forget chmod a+x)
When you use apt or apt-get as a user, that user is able to use sudo. Like Frank Qiu described, sudo does not pass environment variables. For that you can add

Defaults env_keep += "http_proxy https_proxy ftp_proxy"
to (e.g.)

/etc/sudoers.d/00-environment 
or directly into the

/etc/sudoers

file. That way you only have to manage the proxy settings in one place.
